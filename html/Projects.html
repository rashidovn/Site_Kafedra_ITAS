<h1>Power-audit</h1>
<p align="justify">In our days all over the world occurs integration processes in power supply of a life and people's activity. Necessity of the coordination of dispatching functions and systems of automatic control to leave a new characteristic mark on all chain of technological management of modes of electric power systems. Moreover, simultaneously with processes of integration in many countries, including Russia, occurs migration to the exchange relations of structures of generation and consumption of electric power.</p>
<p align="justify">Thereupon department of ITAS conducts the analysis and studying of the market of systems of electric power monitoring and control.
</p>
<h2>E-home - the electric power accounting system</h2>
<p>The system is intended for installation in residential and industrial buildings. Provides data collection from any electric meters having a pulse output. Connection to ribbon cable systems of the security and fire-signal systems is possible. A kernel of system is the server under control of OS ASP Linux 7.3 (the distribution kit is certificated by  state technical commission of the Russian Federation to the 5th class of security and to the 4th level of the control). Data collection is conducted by means of DBMS MySQL. The system has an opportunity of data exchange with ERP-systems for formation of the various accounting documentation and a calculating bills, and as an opportunity of delivery of data in HTML through the built in web-server for the operative control of the debts and viewing of statistics of electric power consumption.</p>
<p>  The system has been introduced in an apartment house in Perm, Lunacharsky's street 54. The additional information and a demo-entrance for acquaintance with system is available to the address of: <a href="http://ehome.sl.perm.ru" target="_blank">ehome.sl.perm.ru</a> (login: energo, password: test:test) </p>
<p>In the educational purposes, on the controller is installed ModBus/TCP server, by means of which use of the controller as unit of SCADA-system is possible. It allows students to train skills of use of SCADA-applications for the processing of various data  and managements of executive mechanisms.</p>
<p>At the stand the unit of commercial accounting system  of the electric power is presented.</p>
