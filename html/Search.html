<h1>Search Tips</h1>
<p>To enter a query into the search engine, just type in a few
descriptive words and click on the <img src="images/search-button.png" align="middle"/> button for a list of
relevant results. Since this search engine only returns web pages that
contain <b>all</b> the words in your query, refining or narrowing your
search is as simple as adding more words to the search terms you have
already entered. Your new query will return a smaller subset of the
pages the search engine found for your original &ldquo;too broad&rdquo; query.</p>
<h2>Choosing Keywords</h2>
<p>For best results, it's important to choose
your keywords wisely. Keep these tips in mind: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Try the obvious first. If you're looking for information on
&ldquo;Object Pascal&rdquo;, enter &ldquo;Pascal&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Object&rdquo;. </li>
  <li>Make keywords as specific as possible. &ldquo;first order calculi&rdquo; gets
more relevant/specific results than &ldquo;calculi&rdquo;. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Automatic &ldquo;and&rdquo; Queries</h2>
<p>By default, this search engine only returns
pages that include all of your search terms. There is no need to
include &ldquo;and&rdquo; between terms.</p>
<h2>Automatic Exclusion of Common Words</h2>
<p>This search engine ignores common words and
characters such as &ldquo;where&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo;, because
they tend to slow down your search without improving the results.</p>
<h2>Capitalization</h2>
<p>Our searches are <b>NOT</b> case sensitive. All
letters, regardless of how you type them, will be understood as lower
case. For example, searches for &ldquo;ITAS&rdquo;, &ldquo;itas&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ItaS&rdquo; will all
return the same results.</p>
<h2>Word Variations</h2>
<p>This search engine uses the stemming technology. Thus, when appropriate, it will
search not only for your search terms, but also for words that are
similar to some or all of those terms. For example, the search for
&ldquo;information&rdquo; will also return some results on &ldquo;informatics&rdquo; and other
related variations of the term.</p>
<h2>Logical Expressions</h2>
<p>The logical operators &ldquo;OR&rdquo;, &ldquo;NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;AND&rdquo;,
&ldquo;(&rdquo; and &ldquo;)&rdquo; are fully supported and, when used, the query string is converted into the logical expression.
The result of that logical expression is calculated, and if it is &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo;,
the document will appear in the search results.</p>
