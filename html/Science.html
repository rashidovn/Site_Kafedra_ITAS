<H1>Researches directions</H1>
<H2>1. PCS</H2>
<P>PCS - Process Control System.</P>
<P>PCS - are designed for optimization of technological processes and manufactures and their efficiency increase by the means of automation based on using of modern computing facilities, microprocessor technics, effective methods and facilities of the control and management.</P>
<P>PCS - it is a set of the hardware-software facilities which are carrying out the control and management on industrial and technological processes supporting a feedback and actively influencing process flow, when it deviate from the default set of parameters, providing regulation and optimization of controlled process.</P>
<P>One of main advantages of PCS is decrease, till full exception, influence of human factor on controlled process, reduction of the personnel, raw material consumptions minimization, improvement of an initial product quality, and finally - essential increase of a production efficiency. The basic functions carried out by similar systems, includes the control and management, data exchange, information accumulation, processing and storage, generation of alerts, construction of schedules and reports.</P>
<P>Recently PCS starts to penetrate into such spheres, as road-traffic management, medicine, mechanical engineering, housing and communal services. The separate direction of their application is military and space technologies where automation systems are used as the built-in facilities of the control and management.</P>
<P>SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system - it is the set of the hardware-software facilities providing an opportunity of monitoring, analysis and management of technological process's parameters by human. It is a component of the automated system.</P>
<H2>2. Buildings automation</H2>
<P>In our days, requirements to modern buildings in field of management and comfort are high enough. Typical buildings have a huge set of pumps, heating systems, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. In conjunction achievement of high power efficiency of such systems, high reliability and convenience of building management also is reached.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Intellectual building systems.</B></FONT></P>
<P>The modern building is equipped with amount of complex engineering systems:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp;Burglar alarm and fire-signal system; <BR/>2.&nbsp;System of access monitoring; <BR/>3.&nbsp;System of external and internal video observation; <BR/>4.&nbsp;System of internal signaling (radio network); <BR/>5.&nbsp;System of power consumption and illumination control; <BR/>6.&nbsp;Emergency control of engineering systems such as: power supplies, ventilation, air-conditioning, heating, elevators; <BR/>7.&nbsp;Parking control system; <BR/>8.&nbsp;System of information security monitoring; <BR/>9.&nbsp;System of ecological control. 
</P>
<P>These systems provide safety of people, account and saving of resources, monitoring of ecological conditions and creation of comfort.</P>
<P>The concept of the "Intellectual building" provides creation of central supervisory console, and if necessary, creation of the local or remote reserve consoles.</P>
<P>From this board, the main dispatcher can carry out the following actions:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp;To conduct video surveillance of a situation both on whole floors and in separate premises of the building. <BR/>2.&nbsp;To control all alerts and to take a decision about their localization. <BR/>3.&nbsp;To operate evacuation of people from the building, in emergency situations and to supervise work of fire-fighting and alarm systems. <BR/>4.&nbsp;To supervise basic parameters of the engineering equipment (power supplies, illumination, ventilation, air-conditioning, heating, elevators and others). <BR/>5.&nbsp;To create building's energy-saving maintenance scripts ("a night mode", the control of presence over premises, regulation of thermal mode and others). <BR/>6.&nbsp;To optimize work of separate subsystems. <BR/>7.&nbsp;To operate separate zones of the building depending on their target use (presentation, conference, a celebratory concert, a rush of invited, etc.).  </P>
<P>Deployment of intellectual building system allows raising economic building maintenance efficiency, due to the following factors:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Decrease of payments for the electric power;</LI>
	<LI>Decrease of power consumption;</LI>
	<LI>Increase of operational reliability of the equipment;</LI>
	<LI>Decrease of the materials consumption;</LI>
	<LI>Increase of labour productivity;</LI>
	<LI>Insurance benefits;</LI>
	<LI>Decrease of  the services complex cost for the period of all life cycle. </LI>
</UL>
<H2>3. Databases & Databanks</H2>
<P>During the age of information technologies appeared the necessity of processing and storage of huge quantity of information. In that way, databases and databanks found the wide practically application in all spheres of human life. On current day there is a huge quantity of DBMS pay-ware as well as freeware. ITAS department trains and successfully applies in research development such databases, as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, InterBase and others. The license agreement with Microsoft and Oracle about granting software, literature and technical support of products delivered by them for students of PSTU training was accepted. </P>
<H2>4. Modeling</H2>
<P> Modeling - is discipline, putting the purpose of models construction and their research by own universal methods, also by specific methods of adjacent sciences with it (mathematics, operations research and programming). Model - is replacement of real object, model is used for researches, when natural experiment is impossible, expensive, dangerous and/or very continuous. </P>
<H2>5. Enterprise Resources Planning Systems (ERP)</H2>
<P>The major problem of the head of any enterprise consist in as much as possible effective usage of available in his disposal monetary, human, commodity and other resources. The head needs timely information about their availability and condition, for taking administrative decisions. Data about internal resources usually comes from the internal discount registers, the data about external resources are formed from different sources of the information (negotiations, press, marketing researches, etc.). For correct usage this data should be entered into uniform system of the administrative account, from which they can be taken in the required kind and during required time.</P>
<P>Without ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) - systems it is already impossible to imagine successful performance of large enterprise. Presently ERP is the basic tool of administrative activity. ERP allows planning financial, human, and material resources, including the on-line control of manufacturing plan performance. ERP - includes all kinds of the accounting and the analysis of economical activity results and ability to process great data volumes. By means of these systems, the director in proper time receives the information about enterprise functioning, and for big territorially-distributed corporations, application of ERP-technologies lets to keep a uniform control system for any branches of manufacture and supports territorially-removed structures.</P>
<H2>6. Systems of artificial intellect</H2>
<p>Development of intellectual systems is divided into two directions - expert systems and imitation of rational activity, expedient behavior.</p>
<p>The first: expert systems are systems of conclusions, which are based on the mathematical logic. At that, these systems can be useful in areas with small dimension, they have more than one serious imperfection: at a conclusion appears a set of the incidental facts, which combinations reach by quantity of huge number, and it is impossible to process these facts on computer. The second lack, it is monotony of mathematical logic, which mismatches human logic. It is recommended to use mechanisms used in expert systems, for embedding in software products, giving to it features of intellectuality. The world of expert systems should change and develop, but extremely difficult to realize this mechanism. Another way - is imitation of intelligence by using imitation models.</p>
<H2>7. Training systems and simulators</H2>
<P>Simulators are ideal facilities for training. Exists both software-based, and the hardware-based simulators, which allows to simulate real physical process. For example, on department in 80th years, has been created the simulator of the crane work. Current simulator allowed training the personnel, working in port, very skillfully and without attracting of real technical equipment. Today this direction develops relatively weakly, despite of heightened interest of the enterprises and the organizations.</P>
<H2>8. WEB - designed systems</H2>
<p>Development of the Internet and the mass usage of web-resources bring to necessity to orient workable information systems to the web-technology. The basic advantages of web-designed systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Availability (an opportunity of reception of the information from any point of globe)</li>
  <li>Distribution (an opportunity of administration and management through the Internet)</li>
  <li>The multi-user access </li>
  <li>Dynamism</li>
</ul>
